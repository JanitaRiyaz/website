# Definition of done

Before committing to the repo, make sure you've checked the following:

- Responsive: make sure pages and components work on all device formats.

- Accessible: We want to be WCAG 2.1 AAA compliant. Don't forget: do images have an alt-attribute?
  Is everything accessible using only a keyboard? Is the contrast high enough?

- Progressive enhancement: all main content should be accessible with JavaScript turned off.
