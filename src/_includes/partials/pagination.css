/* 
    Check here for an example of the pagination.
    Right now, the code supports a very simple pagination with 
    `previous` and `next` links. Perhaps it's best to put
    temporary styling on it with the flavor of the design,
    and make a note to discuss this with Ready for Take-Off, our designers.
    Add any notes here: https://github.com/fronteers/website/issues/79 

    Example of the design for pagination can be found here:
